# Stock-Analysis
# Challenge
In this chalenge Steve is researching gathering data for the entire stock market over the last fes years
In order for the code to return thousands of stock the code is going to refactor inorder to loop through the data only once
Refactoring would accomplish the same task with the code but in a more efficient way
All the data will be collected in a single pass
